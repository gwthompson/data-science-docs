# How to become a data scientist

### 1. Understand the Fundamentals

### stats
- stats intro: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats/

### Linalg
- https://towardsdatascience.com/boost-your-data-sciences-skills-learn-linear-algebra-2c30fdd008cf

### 2. Understand basics of ML
- http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ (good practical advice)
- read sections of this book while trying to implement them on the project, for each section try to implement it, and understand all the complexities in relation to your task

### 3. Understand model bias
- slides on bias: https://github.com/parker84/data-science-docs/blob/master/ds_topics/model_bias.pptx
- bias from conditioning: https://medium.com/causal-data-science/understanding-bias-a-pre-requisite-for-trustworthy-results-ee590b75b1be
- censorship bias: https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Survival%20Analysis%20intro.html
- some additional examples of bias: https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/10/27/4-human-caused-biases-machine-learning/?amp=1
- Now in your projects below, and any of the projects you ever work on you need to be very concerned about these biases. These biases are what will result in catastrophic results in prod, and are much more important than selecting the optimal model

### To Learn traditional Data Science

#### a) EDA:
- https://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html

#### b) Learn sql
- https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql

#### c) Do a project
- https://github.com/parker84/MMF_UofT/tree/master/credit_risk
- data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

### To Learn neural networks

#### a) Understand neural nets
- http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
- read sections of this book while trying to implement them on the project, for each section try to implement it, and understand all the complexities in relation to your task
- http://cs231n.github.io/ (a lot of good practical advice)
    - refer to here for tuning and stuff

#### b) Do a project
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/stumbleupon/data
- try cnn, lstms, attention, and transfer learning using tfhub, use regularization, and try to tune optimally
